# Shockzam - Shazam for PC #
[Shazam](http://www.shazam.com) is a popular music identification service for smartphones.
It works really well, but it doesn't have a version for Windows computers.
_Shockzam_ is a little software that takes a sample of music from your PC (What you hear), and recongnize it by sending it to Shazam's servers.

It basically does exactly the same thing as the official Shazam app, but on your windows computer instead of your smartphone.

## How it works ##
This software listens to a 5-seconds sample from your PC. Then it sends it to Shazam's server at http://msft.shazamid.com/orbit/DoRecognition1, and makes it think the request was sent from a smartphone.

## Usage ##
_Shockzam_ is a portable software, so you don't have to install anything.
